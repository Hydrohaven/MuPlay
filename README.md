# MuPlay
Voice-automated music player using Java and Sphinx4 Voice Recognition API

# Installation
I don't know how to properly compile Java projects that use third-party API into .exe's so there is no installation yet

# Usage
Simple music player that uses local music files (mp3, m4a, etc) and voice automation to control the music's play state, volume, and current or previous song

# Disclaimer
MuPlay is always listening to your microphone because thats how I like to use it. I don't even know how to toggle the microphone but I sure can tell you I don't know how to steal your information through the program
