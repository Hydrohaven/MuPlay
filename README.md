# MuPlay
Voice-automated music player using Java and Sphinx4 Voice Recognition API

# Installation
I don't know how to properly compile Java projects that use third-party API into .exe's so there is no installation yet

# Usage
Simple music player that uses local music files (.mp3, .m4a, etc) and voice automation to control the music's play state, volume, and current or previous song

# Disclaimer
MuPlay is always listening to your microphone because thats how I like to use it. I don't even know how to toggle the microphone but I sure can tell you I don't know how to steal your information through the program

# Future Updates
This was a project I made around August of 2022 because I wanted something on my college apps and I haven't updated it since. I'd love to come back to it sometime as I'm kind've missing Java as of late and I think I'm probably a much better programmer since than. If anything, finally using something like SceneBuilder or FXML instead of that dog vanilla JavaGUI that I have no idea how to use would make this project look and feel better.
